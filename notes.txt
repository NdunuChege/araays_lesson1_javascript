Arrays are special types of variables that holds more than one item at once
let <variable_name> = []
array methods :non-destructive and destructive

   non-destructive - slice(), concat()
   destructive - splice(), push(), pop(), unshift(), shift()

   push() - <array name>.push("<data_type_element">), addin an anonymous function, the name is omitted. These functions are often used in situations where you don’t need to reuse the function outside its immediate context.
   How splice works
   1. splice(<start_index>, <no_of_elements>)
   2. slice() -  creating a copy of the original

   Anonymous functions - usually created for specific tasks, assigned to variables or used as arguments for other functions, in an anonymous function, the name is omitted.
